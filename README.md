To quickly run the project on the command line, head to the root folder and enter:
gradlew bootRun
to start the application. You can then access the endpoints at http://localhost:8080/endpointname.
Example: http://localhost:8080/mymessages	username: superman password: superman
The preferred way to play around with the application is with Postman. For the basic authentication
field, use username:superman and password:superman.
